  Hi, Ryan here! 


  I'm a rising senior studying **Computer Science** at **University of Massachusetts Boston**, graduating in Winter of 2020. For the past few months, I've been a research assistant in their [Visual Attention Lab](https://www.cs.umb.edu/~marc/lab/), developing a visual feedback application that interfaces with our eye-tracking hardware using JavaScript, Electron, and WebGL. It's based on some research from our collaborators in the medical field and is intended as an exercise that can improve conditions for people with amblyopia (lazy eye), strabismus (crossed eyes), and possibly ADHD.
  
  Currently, I'm spending the Summer working as a software engineering intern at a large finance company in Boston, where I've been mostly working on a full stack web application team (TypeScript/Angular/Node frontend, Java backend) used by traders to manage order flow. I've also been working with another team implementing some authentication/single-sign-on using AWS Lambda/API Gateway. 
  
  Last year, I had my first experience as a software engineering intern at a telecom equipment company, refactoring C/C++ code in platform tools used in embedded operating systems. I also got to perform a bit of devOps. 
  
  Before I had any professional or university experience, I started programming by making games as part of game jams, (usually) 48-hour sprints where developers gather in person and/or online to create a game from scratch, often with random constraints decided by the judges (Ex: Ludum Dare, Global Game Jam, Indie Speed Run). I still also enjoy participating in competitive programming events such as Google Code Jam, KickStart, or those on websites like HackerRank and LeetCode.
  
  This site aggregates some of my work, thoughts, and links to other places you can connect with me. My passion for engineering has driven my interest in a wide range of topics and technolgies across the stack, and I aim to always stay learning. 
  
  Outside of work I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, darts, travel, film, and music.

Thanks,
