  Hi, my name is Ryan Dern. 

  Currently, I'm a junior studying **Computer Science** at **University of Massachusetts Boston**. This site aggregates some of my work, thoughts, and links to other places you can connect with me. My passion for engineering has fueled my interest in a wide range of topics such as: Aerospace, Robotics, Computer Vision, Machine Learning, DevOps, Mobile Development, and Game Programming (which is what first sparked my desire to write code and continues to influence the way I think about systems).

  Outside of work I enjoy rock climbing, hiking, darts, travel, film, and racing. I regularly pursue personal projects and engage in self-driven learning to gain new skills that will help me solve the problems that interest me or brush up on skills I haven't had the chance to exercise in a while. The open source community in particular has been invaluable for this.

  If you'd like to connect, please feel free to shoot me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ryan-dern-52275488/)

Thanks,    
Ryan
